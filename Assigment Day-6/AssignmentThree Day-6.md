# Assignment-3 Day-6

## 1.Explain as much as you know about objects in javascript? (A long answer expected).
In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a unique string (or symbol) and each value can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, arrays, primitives, or even undefined. Objects are instances of the `Object` class, and they are dynamically created, meaning their structure can be modified during runtime.

## Object Literal

One of the most common ways to create objects in JavaScript is by using object literals `{}`. This involves defining key-value pairs within curly braces, separated by commas.

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};
-A object is a non primitive data type in javascript which is used to store the data in key value pair.
-The object is a collection of properties and methods.
-The properties are the values of the object.
-The methods are the functions of the object.
-The object is created using the curly braces {}.
-The properties and methods are separated by a comma.
-The properties and methods are accessed using the dot operator.
-Objects in javascript are mutable and can be changed.
-Objects in javascript are dynamic and can be extended.
